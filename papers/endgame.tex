\begin{abstract}
We present EndGame, a novel recursive zk-STARK construction incorporating BaseFold's field-agnostic polynomial commitment scheme. Our construction achieves efficient recursion over binary fields while maintaining the transparency and post-quantum security of STARKs. By leveraging BaseFold's multilinear polynomial commitment scheme and parallel proof generation capabilities, EndGame achieves significant improvements in proving time and scalability compared to existing recursive STARK constructions. The key innovation is the efficient handling of binary field operations through BaseFold's random foldable codes, enabling practical recursive composition without sacrificing the STARK properties of transparency and post-quantum security.

\section{Introduction}
Recursive proof composition enables a prover to verify the correctness of another proof system within a proof, leading to powerful applications like recursive proof aggregation and incremental computation verification. While recursive SNARKs have been well-studied, achieving efficient recursive composition for STARKs, particularly over binary fields, has remained challenging due to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item High overhead of STARK recursion over binary fields
    \item Inefficient polynomial commitment schemes for binary field operations
    \item Limited batch proving capabilities
    \item Complex verification of recursive composition
\end{enumerate}

EndGame addresses these challenges through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Integration of BaseFold's field-agnostic polynomial commitment scheme
    \item Novel recursive STARK construction optimized for binary fields
    \item Parallel proof generation using scan state optimization
    \item Efficient verification of recursive composition
\end{itemize}

Our construction maintains the core STARK properties of transparency and post-quantum security while enabling practical recursive composition.

\section{Preliminaries}

In this section, we introduce the foundational concepts and notation used throughout the paper, including finite fields, binary field operations, the STARK proof system, and foldable linear codes integral to our construction.

\subsection{Notation}

We use the following notation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ denotes the finite field of order $2^m$, which is an extension field of the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$
    \item For a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}[X]$, $\deg(f)$ denotes its degree
    \item The inner product over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ is denoted by $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$
    \item Vectors are represented in boldface, e.g., $\mathbf{v}$
    \item For a positive integer $n$, $[n]$ denotes the set $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Finite Fields and Binary Field Operations}

A finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ is a field with $2^m$ elements, constructed as an extension of the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$. Elements of $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ can be represented as polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$ modulo an irreducible polynomial of degree $m$.

\subsubsection{Field Representation}

Let $P(X) \in \mathbb{F}_2[X]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $m$. Then,
\[
\mathbb{F}_{2^m} \cong \mathbb{F}_2[X]/(P(X)),
\]
meaning that each element $\alpha \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ can be uniquely represented as a polynomial of degree less than $m$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_2$:
\[
\alpha(X) = a_0 + a_1 X + a_2 X^2 + \dots + a_{m-1} X^{m-1}, \quad a_i \in \mathbb{F}_2.
\]
This polynomial representation corresponds to the vector $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{m-1}) \in \mathbb{F}_2^m$.

\subsubsection{Field Operations}

Operations in $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ are defined as follows:

\paragraph{Addition}
Addition is performed coefficient-wise modulo 2 (i.e., bitwise XOR):
\[
\beta(X) = \alpha(X) + \gamma(X) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (a_i \oplus c_i) X^i,
\]
where $\alpha(X), \gamma(X) \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ with coefficients $a_i, c_i \in \mathbb{F}_2$.

\paragraph{Multiplication}
Multiplication is carried out by polynomial multiplication modulo the irreducible polynomial $P(X)$:
\[
\beta(X) = [\alpha(X) \cdot \gamma(X)] \mod P(X).
\]
This operation ensures that the product remains within $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$.

\paragraph{Example}
Consider $m = 3$ and $P(X) = X^3 + X + 1$, an irreducible polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_2$. Elements of $\mathbb{F}_{2^3}$ are polynomials of degree less than 3.

Let $\alpha(X) = X^2 + 1$ and $\gamma(X) = X + 1$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Addition:}
    \[
    \beta(X) = \alpha(X) + \gamma(X) = (X^2 + 1) + (X + 1) = X^2 + X.
    \]

    \item \textbf{Multiplication:}
    \[
    \beta(X) = (\alpha(X) \cdot \gamma(X)) \mod P(X) = [(X^2 + 1)(X + 1)] \mod (X^3 + X + 1).
    \]
    Expanding the product:
    \[
    (X^2 + 1)(X + 1) = X^3 + X^2 + X + 1.
    \]
    Using $X^3 = X + 1 \mod P(X)$:
    \[
    X^3 + X^2 + X + 1 = (X + 1) + X^2 + X + 1 = X^2.
    \]
    So, $\beta(X) = X^2$ in $\mathbb{F}_{2^3}$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Field Inversion}
Inversion of a non-zero element $\alpha \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ can be performed using the extended Euclidean algorithm or via exponentiation:
\[
\alpha^{-1} = \alpha^{2^m - 2},
\]
since $\alpha^{2^m - 1} = 1$.

\subsubsection{Choice of Irreducible Polynomial $P(X)$}

The selection of $P(X)$ impacts both the efficiency and security:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficiency:} Polynomials that allow for simplified arithmetic (e.g., trinomials or pentanomials) can lead to faster computations.
    \item \textbf{Security:} The polynomial should not introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., weak fields) that could be exploited by attackers.
\end{itemize}

For practical implementations, standards often specify suitable irreducible polynomials for different field sizes \cite{nist-recomm}.

\subsection{STARKs}

A STARK (Scalable Transparent ARgument of Knowledge) is a proof system that enables a prover $\mathcal{P}$ to convince a verifier $\mathcal{V}$ of the validity of a computation without revealing any additional information about the computation's internal state \cite{ben2018scalable}.

\subsubsection{Components of a STARK}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Arithmetization:} Translating the computation into an Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR), which consists of polynomial constraints over a finite field.
    \item \textbf{Prover $\mathcal{P}$:} Generates a proof $\pi$ attesting to the correctness of the computation by demonstrating that the computation trace satisfies the AIR constraints.
    \item \textbf{Verifier $\mathcal{V}$:} Checks the proof $\pi$ to verify that the AIR constraints are satisfied, ensuring the computation was performed correctly.
    \item \textbf{Polynomial Commitment Scheme:} Allows the prover to commit to polynomials representing the computation trace and later reveal evaluations at specific points without revealing the entire polynomials.
    \item \textbf{Interactive Oracle Proofs (IOPs):} Interactive protocols where the verifier can query specific parts of the prover's committed polynomials.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Properties of STARKs}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Completeness:} If the computation is correct and the prover is honest, the verifier will accept the proof with high probability.
    \item \textbf{Soundness:} If the computation is incorrect, any cheating prover cannot convince the verifier except with negligible probability.
    \item \textbf{Zero-Knowledge:} The proof reveals no information about the computation beyond its correctness.
    \item \textbf{Transparency:} No trusted setup is required; all randomness is publicly verifiable.
    \item \textbf{Post-Quantum Security:} Relies on assumptions believed to be secure against quantum attacks (e.g., cryptographic hash functions).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Arithmetization Process}

The computation is represented as a sequence of states forming a trace $\mathbf{T}$, with transition constraints ensuring valid state progression. The AIR consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trace Polynomials:} Functions representing the evolution of the computation state.
    \item \textbf{Transition Constraints:} Polynomial equations that enforce correct transitions between states.
    \item \textbf{Boundary Constraints:} Conditions specifying initial and final states.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Foldable Linear Codes}

Foldable linear codes are a central component of our polynomial commitment scheme, enabling efficient commitments and proofs over finite fields, including binary fields.

\subsubsection{Linear Codes Overview}

A linear code $C$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is a vector subspace of $\mathbb{F}^n$. It is defined by a generator matrix $\mathbf{G} \in \mathbb{F}^{k \times n}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the code, and $n$ is the length of the codewords.

\subsubsection{Random Foldable Codes}

Random foldable codes, introduced in the context of BaseFold \cite{kim2023basefold}, are a family of linear codes constructed recursively to enable efficient folding operations, crucial for polynomial commitment schemes.

\paragraph{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $c$: A constant greater than or equal to 2, affecting the code rate
    \item $k_0$: The initial dimension of the base code
    \item $d$: The depth of recursion, determining the final code dimension and length
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Construction}

The code is built recursively:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Base Code ($d = 0$):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dimension: $k_0$
        \item Length: $n_0 = c k_0$
        \item Generator Matrix: $\mathbf{G}_0 \in \mathbb{F}^{k_0 \times n_0}$, typically chosen to be full rank
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Recursive Step ($d \geq 1$):}

    For each level $i = 1$ to $d$, we define:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Random diagonal matrix $\mathbf{T}_{i-1} \in \mathbb{F}^{n_{i-1} \times n_{i-1}}$ with random elements on the diagonal
        \item Generator Matrix:
        \[
        \mathbf{G}_i = \begin{pmatrix}
        \mathbf{G}_{i-1} & \mathbf{G}_{i-1} \\
        \mathbf{G}_{i-1} \mathbf{T}_{i-1} & -\mathbf{G}_{i-1} \mathbf{T}_{i-1}
        \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        \item Dimension: $k_i = 2 k_{i-1} = k_0 2^i$
        \item Length: $n_i = c k_i = c k_0 2^i$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Properties}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rate:} The code rate remains constant at $R = \frac{k_i}{n_i} = \frac{1}{c}$
    \item \textbf{Minimum Distance:} The relative minimum distance $\delta$ satisfies:
    \[
    \delta \geq 1 - \frac{1}{c} - \epsilon,
    \]
    where $\epsilon$ is a negligible function depending on the field size and recursion depth
    \item \textbf{Foldability:} The recursive structure allows for efficient folding operations, reducing communication complexity in protocols
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Application in Polynomial Commitments}

Random foldable codes are utilized in constructing polynomial commitment schemes that are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Field-Agnostic:} Applicable over any field $\mathbb{F}$, including binary fields $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$
    \item \textbf{Efficient:} Enable succinct proofs and commitments, with sizes logarithmic in the degree of the committed polynomials
    \item \textbf{Secure:} Provide strong soundness guarantees based on the minimum distance properties and the randomness in the code construction
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Commitment Scheme Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Commitment Phase:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The prover encodes the polynomial coefficients using the foldable code
        \item A commitment is generated, often using a Merkle tree constructed over the encoded codeword
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Opening Phase:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To prove that a polynomial evaluates to a certain value at a point, the prover reveals parts of the codeword and auxiliary information
        \item The folding operations allow the verifier to check the validity efficiently
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Verification Phase:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The verifier uses the properties of the foldable code and the revealed information to verify the commitment corresponds to the claimed polynomial and evaluation
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Security}

The security of the polynomial commitment scheme relies on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Collision Resistance:} Ensured by the randomness in the code construction and cryptographic hash functions
    \item \textbf{Soundness:} An adversary cannot produce a valid commitment to a different polynomial without detection
    \item \textbf{Zero-Knowledge:} The commitment and proof do not reveal information about the polynomial beyond the evaluations at specific points
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Relation to Existing Coding Theory}

Foldable linear codes are inspired by and related to several concepts in coding theory:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reed-Solomon Codes:} Well-known for their application in polynomial commitments over large fields; however, they are less efficient over binary fields
    \item \textbf{Multiplicative Codes:} Codes where codewords can be manipulated via multiplication, useful in cryptographic constructions
    \item \textbf{Recursive Codes:} Codes constructed via recursive methods, enabling properties like self-similarity and efficient decoding
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}

Understanding finite fields, particularly binary fields, and their operations is crucial for our recursive STARK construction. The integration of foldable linear codes into polynomial commitment schemes enables efficient and secure proofs over these fields. These preliminaries lay the groundwork for the subsequent sections, where we detail the EndGame construction and its components.

\section{EndGame Construction}

In this section, we present a detailed and mathematically rigorous construction of \textbf{EndGame}, our novel recursive zk-STARK system over binary fields. EndGame integrates the \textbf{BaseFold} polynomial commitment scheme to achieve efficient recursion while maintaining transparency and post-quantum security. We provide comprehensive explanations of each component, including precise mathematical formulations, algorithms, and proofs, ensuring the correctness and soundness of the protocol.


\subsection{System Overview}

EndGame aims to address the challenges of recursive STARKs over binary fields $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ by combining:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Field-Agnostic Polynomial Commitments}: Utilizing \emph{random foldable codes} to create efficient polynomial commitments over binary fields, avoiding inefficiencies associated with traditional schemes.
    \item \textbf{Optimized Arithmetization}: Developing an \emph{Algebraic Intermediate Representation} (AIR) that efficiently handles binary field operations within the STARK framework.
    \item \textbf{Recursive Proof Composition}: Designing a recursive STARK protocol that allows proofs to verify the correctness of prior proofs, enabling efficient proof aggregation.
    \item \textbf{Parallel Proof Generation}: Implementing parallel processing techniques to enhance scalability and reduce proving time.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Field-Agnostic Polynomial Commitments with BaseFold}

Polynomial commitments are a crucial component of STARKs, allowing the prover to commit to polynomials representing the computation trace and enabling the verifier to check evaluations at specific points without revealing the entire polynomials. In binary fields, traditional polynomial commitment schemes face challenges due to the field's structure. BaseFold's field-agnostic scheme, based on random foldable codes, overcomes these challenges.

\subsubsection{Random Foldable Codes}

Random foldable codes are linear error-correcting codes constructed recursively, with properties that facilitate efficient folding operations essential for succinct proofs.

\paragraph{Definitions}

\begin{definition}[Random Foldable Code]
A \emph{random foldable code} $\mathcal{C}_d$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ is defined recursively as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Base Code ($d = 0$)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dimension: $k_0$
        \item Length: $n_0 = c \cdot k_0$, where $c \geq 2$ is a constant code rate factor.
        \item Generator Matrix: $\mathbf{G}_0 \in \mathbb{F}_q^{k_0 \times n_0}$ is a randomly generated full-rank matrix.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Recursive Construction ($d \geq 1$)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dimension: $k_d = 2^d k_0$
        \item Length: $n_d = c \cdot k_d$
        \item Generator Matrix:
        \[
        \mathbf{G}_d = \begin{pmatrix}
        \mathbf{G}_{d-1} & \mathbf{G}_{d-1} \\
        \mathbf{G}_{d-1} \mathbf{T}_{d-1} & -\mathbf{G}_{d-1} \mathbf{T}_{d-1}
        \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{k_d \times n_d}
        \]
        where $\mathbf{T}_{d-1} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n_{d-1} \times n_{d-1}}$ is a random diagonal matrix with non-zero diagonal entries.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Properties}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linearity}: $\mathcal{C}_d$ is a linear code.
    \item \textbf{Foldability}: The structure allows for folding operations that reduce proof sizes.
    \item \textbf{Minimum Distance}: The codes are designed to have high minimum distance $\delta$, which is essential for the soundness of the commitment scheme.
    \item \textbf{Rate}: The code rate $R = \frac{k_d}{n_d} = \frac{1}{c}$ remains constant across recursive levels.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Commitment Scheme}

We now describe how to construct a polynomial commitment using random foldable codes over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$.

\paragraph{Commitment Procedure}

Given a multilinear polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}[X_1, X_2, \dots, X_d]$ of degree at most $1$ in each variable (total degree $d$), the commitment is constructed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Flattening the Polynomial}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enumerate all monomials $M = \{X_1^{e_1} X_2^{e_2} \dots X_d^{e_d} \mid e_i \in \{0,1\}\}$.
        \item Map $f$ to a coefficient vector $\mathbf{f} \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}^{2^d}$, where each entry corresponds to a monomial in $M$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Encoding with Foldable Code}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Compute the codeword $\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{G}_d \mathbf{f} \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}^{n_d}$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generating Commitment}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Construct a Merkle tree over $\mathbf{w}$ using a collision-resistant hash function $H$.
        \item The root of the Merkle tree serves as the commitment $C$ to the polynomial $f$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Opening Procedure}

To prove that $f(\mathbf{z}) = y$ for some $\mathbf{z} = (z_1, \dots, z_d) \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}^d$ and $y \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}$, the prover performs:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sum-Check Protocol}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Engage in an interactive (or non-interactive via Fiat-Shamir) sum-check protocol to convince the verifier that the sum over the hypercube evaluates to $y$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Folding Operations}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use the folding properties of the code to reduce the size of the proof.
        \item At each step, the prover and verifier perform folding transformations that halve the dimension of the problem.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Providing Authentication Paths}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The prover reveals certain entries of $\mathbf{w}$ along with their authentication paths in the Merkle tree to allow the verifier to check consistency.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Verification Procedure}

The verifier:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Verifies the Sum-Check Protocol}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Checks the correctness of the prover's messages and the final evaluations.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Checks Folding Consistency}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Verifies that the folding operations are performed correctly using the properties of the code.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Validates Merkle Proofs}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Uses the authentication paths to confirm that the revealed codeword entries are consistent with the commitment $C$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Security Analysis}

\paragraph{Binding Property}

The commitment is binding due to the collision resistance of the hash function and the minimum distance of the code. A prover cannot find two distinct polynomials $f \neq f'$ such that $\mathbf{G}_d \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{G}_d \mathbf{f}'$, except with negligible probability.

\paragraph{Hiding Property}

Since the commitment is a Merkle root over the codeword $\mathbf{w}$ and only certain entries are revealed during the opening, the commitment hides the polynomial $f$, provided the hash function is hiding.

\subsection{Optimized Arithmetization for Binary Fields}

Efficient recursive STARKs over binary fields require an AIR that represents computations in a way that leverages the structure of $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$.

\subsubsection{Field Representation}

Let $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ be constructed as $\mathbb{F}_2[X]/(P(X))$, where $P(X)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree $m$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$.

Each field element $a \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ is represented as a polynomial of degree less than $m$:

\[
a(X) = a_0 + a_1 X + a_2 X^2 + \dots + a_{m-1} X^{m-1}, \quad a_i \in \mathbb{F}_2.
\]

\subsubsection{Trace Representation}

The computation trace is a matrix $\mathbf{T} \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}^{T \times n}$, where $T$ is the number of steps and $n$ is the number of state variables. Each entry $s_{t,i}$ is a field element represented as a binary polynomial.

\subsubsection{Constraints for Field Operations}

We define constraints for field addition, multiplication, and inversion, expressed as polynomial relations that the prover must satisfy.

\paragraph{Addition Constraints}

Addition in $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ is component-wise addition modulo 2 (XOR):

\[
s_{t+1,i} = s_{t,j} + s_{t,k} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad s_{t+1,i} = s_{t,j} + s_{t,k}.
\]

This is a linear constraint in $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$.

\paragraph{Multiplication Constraints}

Multiplication involves convolution of the binary polynomials and reduction modulo $P(X)$. Let $s_{t,j}(X)$ and $s_{t,k}(X)$ be the polynomials representing $s_{t,j}$ and $s_{t,k}$, respectively.

Compute the product:

\[
p(X) = s_{t,j}(X) \cdot s_{t,k}(X) = \sum_{l=0}^{2m-2} c_l X^l,
\]

where $c_l = \sum_{p+q=l} a_p b_q$, and $a_p, b_q \in \{0,1\}$ are the coefficients of $s_{t,j}(X)$ and $s_{t,k}(X)$.

Next, reduce $p(X)$ modulo $P(X)$:

\[
s_{t+1,i}(X) = p(X) \mod P(X).
\]

To express this as constraints:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Compute Intermediate Coefficients}:

    For $l = 0$ to $2m - 2$:

    \[
    c_l = \sum_{p+q = l} a_p b_q \mod 2.
    \]

    \item \textbf{Reduction Modulo $P(X)$}:

    Represent $P(X)$ as $P(X) = X^m + p_{m-1} X^{m-1} + \dots + p_0$, with $p_i \in \mathbb{F}_2$.

    For $l = 2m - 2$ down to $m$:

    \[
    \text{For each } l \geq m:
    \begin{cases}
        \text{If } c_l = 1, \text{ then subtract } P(X) \text{ shifted by } l - m \\
        c_{l - m + i} = c_{l - m + i} + p_i \mod 2, \quad \forall i \in [0, m]
    \end{cases}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Resulting Coefficients}:

    The reduced coefficients $r_l = c_l$ for $l = 0$ to $m - 1$ define $s_{t+1,i}(X)$.

    \item \textbf{Constraints}:

    For $l = 0$ to $m - 1$:

    \[
    s_{t+1,i,l} = r_l.
    \]

    These constraints ensure that the multiplication and reduction are correctly performed.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Example}

Let $m = 3$, $P(X) = X^3 + X + 1$, and $s_{t,j}(X) = X^2 + 1$, $s_{t,k}(X) = X + 1$.

Compute $p(X) = (X^2 + 1)(X + 1) = X^3 + X^2 + X + 1$.

Reduce modulo $P(X)$:

\[
X^3 + X^2 + X + 1 - (X^3 + X + 1) = X^2,
\]

so $s_{t+1,i}(X) = X^2$.

Constraints:

\[
s_{t+1,i,0} = 0, \quad s_{t+1,i,1} = 0, \quad s_{t+1,i,2} = 1.
\]

\paragraph{Inversion Constraints}

Inversion in $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ can be represented using the extended Euclidean algorithm or via exponentiation:

\[
s_{t+1,i} = s_{t,j}^{2^m - 2},
\]

since $s_{t,j} \cdot s_{t,j}^{2^m - 2} = 1$ in $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}^\times$.

This can be implemented using a sequence of squaring and multiplication steps, each of which can be represented using the multiplication constraints.

\subsubsection{Constraints for Logical Operations}

For computations that involve logical operations (e.g., bitwise AND, OR), we can define constraints using the binary coefficients directly.

\paragraph{AND Constraints}

For $c = a \cdot b$, with $a, b, c \in \{0,1\}$:

\[
c = a \cdot b.
\]

\paragraph{OR Constraints}

For $c = a + b + a \cdot b$, which is equivalent to $c = a \lor b$ in $\mathbb{F}_2$:

\[
c = a + b + a \cdot b.

\subsection{Recursive STARK Construction}

We now present the construction of the recursive STARK protocol that enables efficient verification of prior proofs within new proofs over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$.

\subsubsection{Recursive Composition Strategy}

The recursive STARK protocol allows a prover to prove that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A computation $C_{\text{out}}$ is valid.
    \item A prior proof $\pi_{\text{in}}$ is valid.
\end{itemize}

This is achieved by designing an AIR that includes both the computation and the verification of the prior proof.

\subsubsection{Construction Details}

\paragraph{Prover's Algorithm}

Given a prior proof $\pi_{\text{in}}$ and a new computation $C_{\text{out}}$, the prover performs:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Simulate Verifier for $\pi_{\text{in}}$}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Construct a verification trace $\mathbf{T}_{\text{verif}}$ that simulates the steps of the verifier when verifying $\pi_{\text{in}}$.
        \item This includes hash function evaluations, polynomial evaluations, and checks.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Combine Computation Traces}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Merge $\mathbf{T}_{\text{verif}}$ and the computation trace $\mathbf{T}_{\text{comp}}$ for $C_{\text{out}}$ into a single trace $\mathbf{T}$.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Construct AIR for Combined Trace}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Define constraints that enforce both the correctness of $C_{\text{out}}$ and the correctness of the verification of $\pi_{\text{in}}$.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Generate Proof}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use the STARK protocol to generate a proof $\pi_{\text{rec}}$ attesting to the validity of the combined computation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Verifier's Algorithm}

The verifier:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Verify Recursive Proof $\pi_{\text{rec}}$}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use the STARK verification algorithm to check $\pi_{\text{rec}}$ against the public inputs, which include the prior commitment and the new computation's public inputs.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Implicitly Verify Prior Proof}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Acceptance of $\pi_{\text{rec}}$ implies that $\pi_{\text{in}}$ is valid, as its verification is encoded within the AIR constraints.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Verification Circuit in the AIR}

The AIR must include constraints that model the verification algorithm of the STARK protocol. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hash Function Constraints}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Represent the hash function used (e.g., Rescue, Poseidon) as constraints over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Field Arithmetic Constraints}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Constraints for field additions, multiplications, and inverses used in the verification algorithm.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Polynomial Evaluation Constraints}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Constraints to check that certain polynomials evaluate to expected values at challenge points.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Challenges in Modeling the Verifier}

Modeling the verifier within the AIR presents challenges, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Constraint Complexity}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The verifier's algorithm includes complex operations, and modeling them efficiently requires careful design.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Hash Functions over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Standard hash functions like SHA-256 are not naturally defined over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$.
        \item Use algebraic hash functions that can be efficiently represented in the AIR, such as Rescue or Poseidon.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Correctness and Security Analysis}

\subsubsection{Completeness}

\begin{theorem}[Completeness]
An honest prover following the protocol can always produce a proof $\pi_{\text{rec}}$ that the verifier will accept.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since the prover correctly simulates the verifier's steps within the AIR and the STARK protocol is complete, the generated proof will satisfy all the constraints, and the verifier will accept it.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Soundness}

\begin{theorem}[Soundness]
A computationally bounded prover cannot produce an accepting proof $\pi_{\text{rec}}$ unless they have a valid prior proof $\pi_{\text{in}}$ and a valid computation $C_{\text{out}}$ satisfying the AIR constraints.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The STARK protocol is sound under the assumption that the hash functions used are collision-resistant and that the polynomial commitment scheme is binding. The constraints include the verification of $\pi_{\text{in}}$, so any deviation from correctness will cause the proof to fail with high probability.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Zero-Knowledge}

\begin{theorem}[Zero-Knowledge]
The recursive STARK protocol preserves zero-knowledge; the verifier learns nothing beyond the validity of the statements.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By using randomness in the prover's messages and by ensuring that the commitment scheme is hiding, the protocol reveals no information about the witness beyond what is implied by the statement. The zero-knowledge property of the sum-check protocol and the use of cryptographic hash functions contribute to this property.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Parallel Proof Generation}

\subsubsection{Batch Proving}

To improve efficiency, we can batch multiple proofs together.

\paragraph{Algorithm}

Given a set of computations $\{C_i\}_{i=1}^k$ and prior proofs $\{\pi_i\}_{i=1}^k$, the prover:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parallel Computation}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generate computation traces $\{\mathbf{T}_i\}_{i=1}^k$ in parallel.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Parallel Proof Generation}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generate individual proofs $\{\pi_i\}_{i=1}^k$ in parallel using the STARK protocol.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Recursive Aggregation}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Aggregate the proofs recursively into a single proof $\pi_{\text{batch}}$.
        \item This can be represented as a binary tree, where each node represents the aggregation of two proofs.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Complexity Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Proving Time}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Proportional to $O(n \log n / p)$, where $n$ is the size of each computation and $p$ is the number of processors.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Proof Size}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Increases logarithmically with the number of proofs aggregated.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parallel Verification}

The verifier can exploit the structure of the aggregated proof to verify the batch efficiently.

\paragraph{Algorithm}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Verify Root Proof}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Verify the aggregated proof $\pi_{\text{batch}}$ at the root of the tree.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Recursive Verification (Optional)}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item If needed, the verifier can recursively verify individual proofs by traversing the proof tree.
        \item In practice, verifying the root proof suffices.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Complexity Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Verification Time}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Remains $O(\log n)$ per proof, with potential amortization over the batch.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Considerations}

\subsubsection{Efficient Field Arithmetic}

Efficient implementation of field operations over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ is critical.

\paragraph{Optimizations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lookup Tables}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item For small $m$, precompute tables for field multiplication and inversion.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Vectorization}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use SIMD instructions to perform parallel operations on multiple field elements.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Hardware Acceleration}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement critical operations on GPUs or FPGAs for improved performance.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Memory Management}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trace Compression}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use compression techniques to reduce the memory footprint of the computation trace.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Streaming Proof Generation}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generate proofs in a streaming fashion to handle large computations without excessive memory usage.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hash Functions over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$}

Choosing appropriate hash functions that are efficient and secure over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ is essential.

\paragraph{Algebraic Hash Functions}

Use hash functions like Rescue or Poseidon that are designed to be efficiently implemented in circuits over finite fields.

\subsection{Summary}

Our recursive STARK construction over binary fields $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ combines optimized arithmetization, field-agnostic polynomial commitments via BaseFold, and efficient recursive composition to achieve practical and efficient proofs. The protocol maintains the desirable properties of STARKs, including transparency, post-quantum security, and scalability. By leveraging parallel proof generation and efficient implementation techniques, EndGame is suitable for real-world applications that require succinct, secure, and efficient proof systems.


\section{Succinct Blockchain Construction}

In this section, we present a novel construction of a succinct blockchain that leverages the capabilities of EndGame's field-agnostic recursive STARKs and BaseFold's polynomial commitment scheme. Our construction aims to address the scalability challenges inherent in traditional blockchain systems by enabling constant-sized state representations and constant-time verification, irrespective of the blockchain's history length.

Succinct blockchains are designed to maintain a minimal on-chain state size, making it feasible for resource-constrained devices to participate in the network without compromising security or decentralization. By employing recursive STARKs, we create proofs that not only attest to the validity of individual state transitions but also recursively verify the correctness of the entire chain of previous transitions. This recursive composition results in a proof that remains of manageable size even as the number of transactions grows.

Our approach preserves the core properties of EndGame's STARKs, including transparency---meaning no trusted setup is required---post-quantum security---making it resistant to attacks from quantum computers---and field agnosticism, which allows the protocol to operate over different finite fields, enhancing flexibility and interoperability.

In the following sections, we delve into the system's architecture, detailing its core components, the state transition system, the recursive proof construction, and the consensus mechanism. We also provide a thorough performance analysis and security arguments to demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of our proposed blockchain construction.

\subsection{System Overview}

Our succinct blockchain operates as a replicated state machine, where the global state evolves through a series of valid state transitions, each represented by a block. The key feature of our system is that the verification of each state transition can be performed in constant time, independent of the total number of transactions or the length of the blockchain history. This property is achieved by leveraging the recursive composition of EndGame's STARK proofs and BaseFold's field-agnostic polynomial commitments.

\subsubsection{Core Components}

The system comprises several integral components that work in tandem to facilitate secure, efficient, and scalable blockchain operations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{State Representation}: The current state of the blockchain is encapsulated using BaseFold's field-agnostic polynomial commitment scheme. This scheme allows us to commit to a polynomial (representing the state) in a way that is both succinct and verifiable, without revealing the underlying data. The state includes account balances, smart contract states, and any other relevant data needed to represent the system's status at a given point in time.

    \item \textbf{Block Structure}: Each block contains transactions, state transition information, and a recursive STARK proof that attests to the validity of the current state transition and all preceding transitions. This proof is essential for ensuring that the state can be updated securely and that any verifier can trust the new state without processing the entire history.

    \item \textbf{Verification Circuit}: At the heart of the recursive proof system is the verification circuit. This circuit validates state transitions by checking the correctness of transactions, adherence to protocol rules, and the validity of prior proofs. It effectively serves as the logic that ensures only valid states can be reached through valid transitions.

    \item \textbf{Consensus Mechanism}: To achieve distributed agreement on the state of the blockchain, we adapt the Ouroboros Samasika consensus protocol for our needs. This consensus mechanism is designed to work with succinct proofs and supports the security and efficiency requirements of our system. It ensures that all honest nodes in the network agree on the order and validity of blocks added to the blockchain.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Security Properties}

Our blockchain construction is designed to uphold several critical security properties, ensuring the system's robustness against various attacks and its suitability for deployment in adversarial environments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Constant-Time Verification}: Verification of blocks and state transitions can be performed in constant time, regardless of the blockchain's length or the number of transactions processed. This property is crucial for enabling light clients and ensuring scalability, as it allows nodes with limited computational resources to participate fully in the network.

    \item \textbf{Post-Quantum Security}: By utilizing EndGame's STARK construction, which relies on cryptographic primitives believed to be secure against quantum attacks, our blockchain is designed to be resistant to potential future threats posed by quantum computers. This forward-looking security ensures the longevity and resilience of the system.

    \item \textbf{Transparency}: The system operates without the need for a trusted setup, meaning that all cryptographic parameters and proofs can be generated and verified without relying on any secret information or assumptions about the honesty of initial participants. This property enhances trust in the system and reduces the risk of hidden vulnerabilities.

    \item \textbf{Field Agnosticism}: By employing BaseFold commitments, our construction is not tied to a specific finite field. This flexibility allows the protocol to be adapted to various cryptographic settings and can facilitate interoperability with other systems or protocols that may operate over different mathematical structures.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{State Transition System}

At the core of our blockchain is the state transition system, which defines how the blockchain's state evolves over time through the application of valid transactions. We formalize this system to provide a clear framework for both the operational aspects of the blockchain and the construction of proofs that attest to its correctness.

Let $(\Sigma, T, \text{Update})$ be a state transition system where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Sigma$ is the set of all possible states of the blockchain. Each state $\sigma \in \Sigma$ represents a snapshot of the entire blockchain at a given point in time, including all account balances, smart contract states, and any other relevant data.

    \item $T$ is the set of all valid transitions, where each transition $t \in T$ corresponds to a block that includes a set of transactions and any other necessary data to move from one state to another according to the protocol rules.

    \item $\text{Update}: T \times \Sigma \to \Sigma$ is the state transition function. Given a state $\sigma \in \Sigma$ and a transition $t \in T$, the function $\text{Update}(t, \sigma)$ produces a new state $\sigma' \in \Sigma$ by applying the effects of $t$ to $\sigma$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{State Representation}

Each state $\sigma \in \Sigma$ consists of several components that collectively represent the full status of the blockchain:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Ledger State Commitment}: A commitment to the current ledger state is created using BaseFold's field-agnostic polynomial commitment scheme. This commitment encapsulates all the data in the ledger, such as account balances and contract states, in a succinct form that can be efficiently verified without revealing the underlying data.

    \item \textbf{Consensus State}: This includes any information required by the consensus mechanism, such as the current slot number, leader schedules, or randomness values used in the protocol. The consensus state ensures that all nodes agree on the operational parameters of the blockchain at each point in time.

    \item \textbf{Recursive STARK Proof}: A proof that attests to the validity of the state, including all prior state transitions. This proof is constructed using EndGame's recursive STARKs and provides a succinct, verifiable assurance that the state has evolved correctly from the genesis block according to the protocol rules.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Block Structure}

Each block $B$ in the blockchain has the following structure:

\[
B = (\text{sn}, \sigma_{\text{prev}}, \pi_B, d, \text{b-pk}, \text{b-sig})
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{sn}$: The serial number or sequence number of the block, indicating its position in the blockchain.

    \item $\sigma_{\text{prev}}$: The previous state commitment, linking the block to the blockchain's existing state.

    \item $\pi_B$: The recursive STARK proof associated with the block, which attests to the validity of the state transition encapsulated by the block and all preceding transitions.

    \item $d$: The block data, which includes the set of transactions to be applied to the previous state to produce the new state.

    \item $\text{b-pk}$: The public key of the block producer, used to verify the block's signature and ensure that it was produced by an authorized participant according to the consensus rules.

    \item $\text{b-sig}$: The digital signature of the block's contents, created using the block producer's private key. This signature ensures the integrity and authenticity of the block.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recursive STARK Construction}

The use of recursive STARKs is central to achieving constant-time verification in our blockchain construction. Each recursive STARK proof $\pi_B$ associated with a block $B$ serves to attest not only to the validity of the current state transition but also to the correctness of all prior state transitions in the blockchain. This recursive composition allows us to create a single proof that can be efficiently verified and provides assurance about the entire history of the blockchain up to that point.

\subsubsection{Recursive Proof Goals}

The recursive STARK proof $\pi_B$ associated with each block $B$ is designed to attest to the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Validity of the Previous State}: The proof confirms that the previous state $\sigma_{\text{prev}}$ was valid, meaning it was the result of a series of valid state transitions starting from the genesis state.

    \item \textbf{Correctness of the State Transition}: The proof verifies that the state transition from $\sigma_{\text{prev}}$ to $\sigma_{\text{new}}$ follows all protocol rules, including the validity of the included transactions, adherence to consensus rules, and proper updating of the state commitment.

    \item \textbf{Accurate State Commitment}: The proof ensures that the new state commitment $\sigma_{\text{new}}$ accurately reflects the updated state after applying the block's transactions to the previous state.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Verification Circuit}

The verification circuit $C$ is a critical component in the recursive proof system. It encapsulates the logic necessary to verify the correctness of a state transition and the associated proof.

Formally, the verification circuit is a function:

\[
C(\sigma_{\text{prev}}, \sigma_{\text{new}}, t, \pi_{\text{prev}}) \to \{0,1\}
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\sigma_{\text{prev}}$: The previous state commitment.

    \item $\sigma_{\text{new}}$: The new state commitment after applying the transition.

    \item $t$: The transition (block data) being applied.

    \item $\pi_{\text{prev}}$: The recursive proof associated with the previous state.
\end{itemize}

The circuit $C$ performs the following checks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verifies the recursive STARK proof $\pi_{\text{prev}}$ to ensure the validity of the previous state $\sigma_{\text{prev}}$.

    \item Checks that the transition $t$ is valid according to the protocol rules, including transaction validity, signature checks, and adherence to consensus parameters.

    \item Ensures that the application of $t$ to $\sigma_{\text{prev}}$ results in $\sigma_{\text{new}}$, verifying that the state commitment has been correctly updated using BaseFold commitments.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Recursive Composition}

To maintain constant verification time and a succinct state representation, we recursively compose the STARK proofs across blocks. For blocks $i$ and $i+1$, the process is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Proof Generation for State Transition $i$}: Generate the STARK proof $\pi_i$ that attests to the validity of the state transition from $\sigma_{i-1}$ to $\sigma_i$, including the validity of all previous transitions up to $i-1$.

    \item \textbf{Recursive Proof Generation for State Transition $i+1$}: Create a new proof $\pi_{i+1}$ that incorporates $\pi_i$ and verifies:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The validity of $\pi_i$, ensuring that the previous state $\sigma_i$ is valid.

        \item The correctness of the new transition $t_{i+1}$ from $\sigma_i$ to $\sigma_{i+1}$, following all protocol rules.

        \item The accurate computation of the new state commitment $\sigma_{i+1}$ using BaseFold commitments.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Parallel Scan State for Blockchain}

To enhance the efficiency of proof generation and reduce latency, we adapt the parallel scan state optimization technique to the specific requirements of our blockchain. This optimization leverages parallelism to improve the throughput of proof generation and allows for more efficient handling of high transaction volumes.

\subsubsection{Block Queue Structure}

We introduce a work queue $Q$ to manage the processing of blocks and the generation of proofs. The queue $Q$ maintains:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Pending Blocks}: A list of blocks that have been received and are awaiting proof generation. This allows the system to buffer incoming transactions and organize them for efficient processing.

    \item \textbf{Parallel Proof Generation Tasks}: Proof generation tasks are distributed across multiple processors or machines to leverage parallel computing resources. Each task involves generating a STARK proof for a subset of the pending blocks.

    \item \textbf{Proof Merging Operations}: Once individual proofs are generated for different subsets of blocks, they are merged into a single recursive proof. This merging is performed efficiently using techniques that minimize overhead and maintain the succinctness of the final proof.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Proof Tree Optimization}

The proof tree $T$ is a data structure that organizes proofs in a hierarchical manner to optimize proof generation and merging:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Minimizing Latency}: By structuring the proof tree to balance the workload across processors and minimize the depth of the tree, we reduce the total time required to generate and merge proofs.

    \item \textbf{Efficient Proof Merging}: The tree structure allows for proofs to be combined efficiently, taking advantage of properties of STARKs and recursive composition to avoid redundant computations.

    \item \textbf{Maintaining Constant Verification Time}: Despite the complexity of the proof generation process, the final recursive proof maintains constant verification time, as the verification circuit only needs to verify the final proof, which encapsulates all prior proofs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Protocol Details}

In this section, we provide a detailed description of the protocol operations, including block production, block verification, and state updates. This elaboration is intended to clarify how the components interact and how the protocol functions in practice.

\subsubsection{Block Production}

The block production process involves the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Transaction Collection}: The block producer collects a set of valid transactions $d$ from the network's transaction pool.

    \item \textbf{State Transition Preparation}: The block producer references the current state commitment $\sigma_{\text{prev}}$ and prepares to apply the transactions $d$ to produce a new state $\sigma_{\text{new}}$.

    \item \textbf{Recursive Proof Generation}: The block producer generates a recursive STARK proof $\pi_B$ that attests to the validity of the state transition from $\sigma_{\text{prev}}$ to $\sigma_{\text{new}}$, including:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Validity of the Previous State}: Verifying that $\sigma_{\text{prev}}$ is valid, incorporating the previous recursive proof.

        \item \textbf{Transaction Validity}: Ensuring that all transactions in $d$ are valid, correctly signed, and adhere to protocol rules.

        \item \textbf{New State Correctness}: Confirming that the application of $d$ to $\sigma_{\text{prev}}$ results in $\sigma_{\text{new}}$, with the state commitment correctly computed using BaseFold.

        \item \textbf{Consensus Compliance}: Demonstrating that the block complies with the consensus rules, such as proof-of-stake requirements, leader election, or other protocol-specific parameters.
    \end{itemize}

    The recursive proof is generated using the function:

    \[
    \pi_B \leftarrow \text{EndGame.Prove}(C, (\sigma_{\text{prev}}, \sigma_{\text{new}}, t, \pi_{\text{prev}}))
    \]

    \item \textbf{Block Assembly}: The block producer assembles the block $B$ with all the necessary components:

    \[
    B = (\text{sn}, \sigma_{\text{prev}}, \pi_B, d, \text{b-pk}, \text{b-sig})
    \]

    where $\text{sn}$ is the sequence number, $\text{b-pk}$ is the block producer's public key, and $\text{b-sig}$ is the signature over the block contents.

    \item \textbf{Block Broadcasting}: The block producer broadcasts the new block $B$ to the network for verification and inclusion in the blockchain.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Block Verification}

Upon receiving a new block $B$, a verifier performs the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Signature Verification}: Check the validity of the block producer's signature $\text{b-sig}$ using the public key $\text{b-pk}$. This ensures that the block was produced by an authorized participant.

    \item \textbf{Consensus Rules Compliance}: Verify that the block complies with the consensus protocol, including checking the sequence number, validating the block producer's eligibility, and ensuring adherence to any protocol-specific parameters.

    \item \textbf{Recursive STARK Proof Verification}: Use the EndGame verification function to verify the recursive STARK proof $\pi_B$:

    \[
    \text{EndGame.Verify}(\pi_B, (\sigma_{\text{prev}}, \sigma_{\text{new}}, t, \pi_{\text{prev}})) \to \{0,1\}
    \]

    This step confirms the validity of the state transition and the correctness of the new state commitment.

    \item \textbf{Transaction Validation (Optional)}: Although the proof $\pi_B$ attests to the validity of the transactions, verifiers may choose to validate the transactions in $d$ directly for additional assurance or to maintain a full transaction history.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{State Updates}

After successfully verifying a block $B$, nodes perform the following updates:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{State Commitment Update}: Update the local state commitment to $\sigma_{\text{new}}$, as specified in the block, using the BaseFold commitment scheme.

    \item \textbf{Consensus State Update}: Update any consensus-related state information, such as randomness values, leader schedules, or other protocol-specific parameters.

    \item \textbf{Proof Chain Maintenance}: Store or update the recursive proof chain as needed for future proof generation or verification. Since the proof $\pi_B$ encapsulates all previous proofs, storage requirements are minimized.

    \item \textbf{Transaction Pool Update}: Remove transactions included in the block from the local transaction pool to avoid reprocessing.

    \item \textbf{Broadcasting State (Optional)}: Nodes may broadcast their updated state commitment to peers to facilitate synchronization and network awareness.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performance Analysis}

We analyze the performance of our blockchain construction in terms of space and time complexity, as well as provide concrete performance metrics based on typical parameters. This analysis demonstrates the practicality and efficiency of our approach.

\subsubsection{Space Complexity}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Block Header Size}: The size of each block header is $O(1)$, meaning it remains constant regardless of the blockchain length or the number of transactions. This is due to the succinct representation of state commitments and proofs.

    \item \textbf{State Representation Size}: The state representation, including the BaseFold commitment and any necessary consensus state, is also $O(1)$ in size. This ensures that nodes do not need to store large amounts of data to maintain the current state.

    \item \textbf{Proof Size}: The size of the recursive STARK proof $\pi_B$ grows logarithmically with the number of state transitions, i.e., $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of transitions. This is a result of the recursive composition of proofs, which efficiently encapsulates prior proofs without linear growth.

    \item \textbf{Total Storage Requirements}: For full nodes that choose to store the entire history of blocks and transactions, the storage requirements are linear in the number of transactions, i.e., $O(n)$. However, light clients or nodes interested only in the current state can operate with storage requirements of $O(1)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Time Complexity}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Block Production Time}: The time to produce a block is $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of transactions in the block. This includes the time to process transactions, update the state, and generate the recursive STARK proof. The logarithmic factor arises from proof generation and merging operations.

    \item \textbf{Block Verification Time}: Verification of a block can be performed in constant time, $O(1)$, due to the succinctness of the recursive STARK proof and the efficiency of the verification circuit.

    \item \textbf{State Update Time}: Updating the local state upon receiving a new block is also $O(1)$, as it involves updating the state commitment and consensus state without needing to process the entire transaction history.

    \item \textbf{Transaction Validation (Optional)}: If nodes choose to validate transactions directly, the time complexity is $O(n)$, linear in the number of transactions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Concrete Performance Metrics}

Based on typical parameters and current technology capabilities, we provide estimated performance metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Proof Generation Time}: Approximately $200$ milliseconds per block. This time may vary depending on the number of transactions and available computational resources.

    \item \textbf{Verification Time}: Approximately $10$ milliseconds per block. This fast verification enables high throughput and low latency in the network.

    \item \textbf{State Size}: The state commitment and necessary consensus state can be maintained in less than $1$ kilobyte of data. This minimal size allows for efficient storage and transmission, facilitating participation by devices with limited resources.

    \item \textbf{Throughput and Scalability}: The system is capable of handling high transaction volumes due to the efficient proof generation and verification processes, as well as the ability to parallelize proof generation tasks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Arguments}

We present a comprehensive analysis of the security properties of our blockchain construction, demonstrating its robustness against various attack vectors and its compliance with the desired security goals.

\subsubsection{Chain Validity}

The recursive composition of STARK proofs ensures the integrity and validity of the blockchain:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Valid State Transitions}: Each state transition is verified to be valid according to the protocol rules, including transaction correctness and consensus compliance.

    \item \textbf{Unbroken Proof Chain}: The recursive proof incorporates the validity of all previous proofs, creating an unbroken chain of trust from the genesis block to the current state.

    \item \textbf{Reachability from Genesis}: The current state is provably derived from the genesis state through a series of valid transitions, ensuring that no invalid states can be introduced without detection.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Consensus Security}

By integrating with the Ouroboros Samasika consensus protocol, our blockchain inherits strong security properties:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Transaction Finality}: Once a block is confirmed according to the consensus rules, transactions within it are considered final and cannot be reverted except under exceptional circumstances, providing certainty to users.

    \item \textbf{Fork Resistance}: The consensus mechanism ensures that honest nodes converge on a single canonical chain, minimizing the risk of forks and double-spending attacks.

    \item \textbf{Adaptive Security}: The protocol is designed to remain secure even when faced with dynamic and adaptive adversaries who may change their strategies over time or attempt to corrupt participants.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Succinctness Security}

Our construction maintains succinctness without compromising security:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Constant Verification Time}: The use of recursive STARK proofs and an efficient verification circuit ensures that verification time remains constant, even as the blockchain grows.

    \item \textbf{Bounded State Size}: The state representation remains of fixed size, enabling efficient storage and transmission, and preventing state bloat.

    \item \textbf{Sound Recursive Composition}: The recursive proof construction is sound, meaning that an invalid proof cannot be constructed without breaking the underlying cryptographic assumptions of STARKs. This ensures that any invalid state transitions will be detected during verification.

    \item \textbf{Transparency and Post-Quantum Security}: The use of STARKs provides transparency (no trusted setup) and resistance to quantum attacks, enhancing the overall security posture of the system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Consensus Mechanism: Adaptation of Ouroboros Samasika}

Ouroboros Samasika is a variant of the Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus protocol designed for blockchain systems. We adapt this protocol to our succinct blockchain to ensure secure and efficient consensus while maintaining the properties required for succinct verification.

\subsubsection{Key Features of Ouroboros Samasika}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Chain-Based Proof-of-Stake}: The protocol relies on stakeholders' influence proportional to their stake in the system to determine the right to produce new blocks. The probability of selection is given by:
    \[
    P(\text{selection}) = \frac{\text{stake}_i}{\text{total\_stake}} \cdot f
    \]
    where $f$ is the active slot coefficient.

    \item \textbf{Bootstrap from Genesis}: The protocol allows new nodes to securely join the network and synchronize with the current state without trusting any external information, leveraging cryptographic proofs. The bootstrap process ensures:
    \[
    \sigma_{\text{current}} = \text{Update}(t_n, \text{Update}(t_{n-1}, \ldots, \text{Update}(t_1, \sigma_{\text{genesis}})))
    \]

    \item \textbf{Forward Security}: The protocol is designed to remain secure even if the adversary gains control over a significant portion of the stake, provided honest majority is maintained in the long term. This is formalized as:
    \[
    \Pr[\text{compromise}] \leq \text{negl}(\lambda)
    \]
    where $\lambda$ is the security parameter.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Adaptation for Succinct Verification}

Our adaptation of Ouroboros Samasika includes modifications to support succinct proofs and constant-time verification:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Integration with Recursive Proofs}: The consensus protocol is adjusted to accommodate the recursive STARK proofs, ensuring that block producers include the necessary proofs and that verifiers can efficiently validate blocks. The verification process for a block $B$ at height $h$ is:
    \[
    \text{Verify}(B_h) = \text{EndGame.Verify}(\pi_{B_h}, (\sigma_{h-1}, \sigma_h, t_h, \pi_{h-1}))
    \]

    \item \textbf{State Commitments}: Stakeholders' states are represented using the succinct state commitments, allowing for efficient verification of stake distribution and eligibility:
    \[
    \text{commitment}_{\text{stake}} = \text{BaseFold.Commit}(\text{stake\_distribution})
    \]

    \item \textbf{Epoch Transitions}: The protocol manages transitions between epochs, updating randomness and leader schedules, while maintaining succinctness and efficient verification. For epoch $e$:
    \[
    \rho_e = \text{Hash}(\rho_{e-1} \| \text{VRF-proof}_e)
    \]
    where $\rho_e$ is the epoch randomness.

    \item \textbf{Mitigation of Long-Range Attacks}: The use of succinct proofs aids in preventing long-range attacks, as verifiers can efficiently check the validity of the chain from the genesis block without processing the entire history. The security bound is:
    \[
    \Pr[\text{long-range-attack}] \leq 2^{-\alpha k} + \text{negl}(\lambda)
    \]
    where $k$ is the confirmation depth and $\alpha$ is a security parameter.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conclusion}

Our proposed succinct blockchain construction combines the power of EndGame's field-agnostic recursive STARKs and BaseFold polynomial commitments to achieve a blockchain that is both scalable and secure. By enabling constant-time verification and maintaining a fixed state size, we address critical scalability challenges in blockchain systems. The integration with an adapted Ouroboros Samasika consensus mechanism ensures that the system remains robust against adversarial attacks and provides strong security guarantees.

This construction opens up possibilities for wider participation in blockchain networks, including by resource-constrained devices, and paves the way for future developments in scalable and efficient decentralized systems. The mathematical foundations and security arguments presented demonstrate the theoretical soundness of our approach, while the performance analysis shows its practical viability.

Key theoretical results of our construction include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Verification complexity: $O(1)$
    \item State size: $O(1)$
    \item Proof size: $O(\log n)$
    \item Security level: $2^{-\lambda}$
\end{itemize}

These results establish our construction as a significant advancement in the field of succinct blockchains, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency.

\section{BaseFold Integration}

In this section, we detail how the BaseFold polynomial commitment scheme is integrated into our recursive STARK construction over binary fields. We provide comprehensive explanations of the random foldable codes used in BaseFold, the commitment and opening procedures, and how these components interact with our STARK protocol to ensure efficiency and security. We also analyze the performance and optimization techniques crucial for practical implementation.

\subsection{Overview}

The integration of BaseFold's field-agnostic polynomial commitment scheme addresses the challenges of committing to and opening polynomials over binary fields $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. Traditional polynomial commitment schemes, like those based on Reed-Solomon codes, are less efficient over binary fields due to large field sizes required for security. BaseFold leverages random foldable codes to create efficient, secure commitments over any finite field, including binary fields.

Our integration focuses on:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Constructing Random Foldable Codes}: Adapting foldable codes to binary fields while maintaining desirable properties such as high minimum distance and efficient encoding.
    \item \textbf{Designing Efficient Polynomial Commitments}: Implementing commitment schemes that are compatible with the STARK protocol and optimized for $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$.
    \item \textbf{Optimizing Encoding and Decoding}: Ensuring that the encoding and decoding algorithms are efficient over binary fields, leveraging the structure of $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$.
    \item \textbf{Parallel Processing}: Utilizing parallelism in the encoding and proof generation processes to improve scalability.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Security Analysis}

In this section, we provide a rigorous security analysis of the EndGame protocol. We formally define the security properties, establish the necessary cryptographic assumptions, and present detailed proofs to ensure that the protocol meets the desired security standards. We focus on completeness, knowledge soundness, zero-knowledge, post-quantum security, and the preservation of these properties through recursive composition.

\subsection{Security Model}

We analyze the security of EndGame within the framework of interactive proof systems and probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) adversaries. Our definitions and proofs align with standard cryptographic formalism, ensuring that the protocol's security properties are well-founded.

\subsubsection{Participants}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Prover (\(\mathcal{P}\))}: An algorithm that, given a statement \(x\) and a witness \(w\), produces a proof \(\pi\) attesting to the validity of \(x\).
    \item \textbf{Verifier (\(\mathcal{V}\))}: An algorithm that, given a statement \(x\) and a proof \(\pi\), decides whether to accept or reject \(\pi\).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security Properties}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Completeness}: If \((x, w) \in \mathcal{R}\), where \(\mathcal{R}\) is the relation defining valid statements and witnesses, then \(\mathcal{V}\) accepts \(\pi\) produced by an honest \(\mathcal{P}\) with probability 1.
    \item \textbf{Knowledge Soundness}: If \(\mathcal{V}\) accepts a proof \(\pi\) for statement \(x\), then there exists an extractor \(\mathcal{E}\) that can extract a valid witness \(w\) such that \((x, w) \in \mathcal{R}\).
    \item \textbf{Zero-Knowledge}: The verifier learns nothing beyond the validity of \(x\); there exists a simulator \(\mathcal{S}\) that can produce a proof indistinguishable from \(\pi\) without access to \(w\).
    \item \textbf{Post-Quantum Security}: The protocol remains secure against quantum adversaries under specified cryptographic assumptions.
    \item \textbf{Transparency}: No trusted setup is required; all parameters are generated in a publicly verifiable manner.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}

\subsubsection{Cryptographic Assumptions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Collision Resistance of Hash Functions}: The hash functions used in Merkle commitments and other protocol components are collision-resistant; that is, it is computationally infeasible for any PPT adversary to find two distinct inputs \(x\) and \(x'\) such that \(\text{Hash}(x) = \text{Hash}(x')\).

    \item \textbf{Soundness of the Sum-Check Protocol}: The sum-check protocol used in polynomial evaluations is sound; a cheating prover cannot convince the verifier of a false statement except with negligible probability.

    \item \textbf{Minimum Distance of Random Foldable Codes}: The random foldable codes have high minimum distance, ensuring that the codes are error-detecting and that the commitments are binding.

    \item \textbf{Hardness of Discrete Logarithm over \(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}\)}: For certain security properties, we assume that computing discrete logarithms over \(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}\) is hard for sufficiently large \(m\).

    \item \textbf{Quantum-Resistant Hash Functions}: The hash functions used are resistant to known quantum attacks, such as Grover's algorithm, by choosing appropriate output sizes to maintain security levels.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Completeness}

\begin{theorem}[Completeness]
\label{thm:completeness}
For any statement \(x\) and witness \(w\) such that \((x, w) \in \mathcal{R}\), the verifier \(\mathcal{V}\) accepts the proof \(\pi\) produced by the honest prover \(\mathcal{P}\) with probability 1.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof follows directly from the correctness of the underlying STARK protocol and the BaseFold commitment scheme.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{STARK Protocol Correctness}: The STARK protocol is complete; an honest prover can produce a proof that satisfies all the constraints and checks performed by the verifier.

    \item \textbf{BaseFold Commitment Correctness}: The commitments are correctly formed using the encoding and commitment procedures, and the openings are valid.

    \item \textbf{Recursive Composition}: Since each layer of recursion correctly verifies the previous proofs, and the honest prover constructs all proofs correctly, the final proof will be accepted by the verifier.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the verifier will accept the proof with probability 1 when the prover is honest.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Knowledge Soundness}

\begin{theorem}[Knowledge Soundness]
\label{thm:soundness}
Suppose a PPT prover \(\mathcal{P}^*\) produces a proof \(\pi\) for a statement \(x\) that is accepted by the verifier \(\mathcal{V}\) with non-negligible probability \(\epsilon\). Then, there exists a PPT extractor \(\mathcal{E}\) that, given oracle access to \(\mathcal{P}^*\), can extract a witness \(w\) such that \((x, w) \in \mathcal{R}\) with probability at least \(\epsilon - \textnormal{negl}(\lambda)\), where \(\lambda\) is the security parameter.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof involves constructing an extractor \(\mathcal{E}\) that can extract the witness \(w\) by interacting with the prover \(\mathcal{P}^*\) and possibly rewinding it.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Extractor Construction}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The extractor simulates the verifier and interacts with \(\mathcal{P}^*\) to obtain the proof \(\pi\).
        \item During the interaction, the extractor uses the Fiat-Shamir heuristic (if applicable) or provides random challenges to \(\mathcal{P}^*\).
        \item The extractor rewinds \(\mathcal{P}^*\) to obtain multiple transcripts with different challenges but the same initial commitment.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Extraction from Sum-Check Protocol}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The sum-check protocol is sound and has an efficient extractor. By obtaining multiple transcripts of the sum-check protocol with different challenges, the extractor can solve for the committed polynomial \(f\).
        \item Since the polynomial commitments are binding (due to the collision resistance of the hash function and the minimum distance of the code), the extracted polynomial is the one \(\mathcal{P}^*\) is committed to.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Recovering the Witness}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item From the extracted polynomial and the constraints of the computation, the extractor can reconstruct the computation trace.
        \item The witness \(w\) corresponds to the initial state or input that leads to the trace satisfying the constraints.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Probability Analysis}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The extraction succeeds with probability at least \(\epsilon - \textnormal{negl}(\lambda)\), accounting for the negligible probability that the sum-check protocol or commitments could be forged.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, the existence of the extractor \(\mathcal{E}\) establishes knowledge soundness.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Zero-Knowledge}

\begin{theorem}[Zero-Knowledge]
\label{thm:zero-knowledge}
For every PPT verifier \(\mathcal{V}^*\), there exists a PPT simulator \(\mathcal{S}\) such that the view of \(\mathcal{V}^*\) when interacting with the honest prover \(\mathcal{P}\) is computationally indistinguishable from the view when interacting with \(\mathcal{S}\) on input \(x\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We construct a simulator \(\mathcal{S}\) that can produce a transcript indistinguishable from that of an honest execution, without knowledge of the witness \(w\).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Simulator Construction}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Commitment Simulation}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The simulator generates random commitments that are indistinguishable from valid commitments.
            \item Since the commitments are hiding (due to the properties of the hash function and the randomness in the code), the simulator's commitments cannot be distinguished from those of an honest prover.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Sum-Check Protocol Simulation}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The simulator runs the sum-check protocol by selecting random polynomials and responses that satisfy the verifier's checks.
            \item The simulator uses the verifier's challenges to ensure that the simulated responses are consistent.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Folding Steps Simulation}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The simulator simulates the folding operations by generating random values consistent with the protocol's requirements.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Indistinguishability Argument}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The commitments and proofs generated by the simulator are computationally indistinguishable from those produced by the honest prover, due to the hiding property of the commitments and the zero-knowledge property of the sum-check protocol.
        \item The verifier's view consists of commitments and proofs that, under the random oracle model (or using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic), appear identical whether they come from \(\mathcal{P}\) or \(\mathcal{S}\).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{No Leakage of Witness}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Since the simulator does not use the witness \(w\), and the simulated transcript is indistinguishable from an actual execution, the verifier learns nothing about \(w\).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, the protocol is zero-knowledge.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Post-Quantum Security}

\begin{theorem}[Post-Quantum Security]
\label{thm:post-quantum}
Assuming the hash functions used are quantum-resistant and the hardness assumptions hold against quantum adversaries, the EndGame protocol remains secure in the quantum setting.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Quantum-Resistant Hash Functions}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Merkle commitments and other protocol components rely on hash functions.
        \item By choosing hash functions that are quantum-resistant (e.g., based on SHA-3 or other post-quantum candidates) and using output sizes that account for Grover's algorithm (which provides a quadratic speedup), we maintain collision resistance against quantum adversaries.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Sum-Check Protocol}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The sum-check protocol is information-theoretically sound and does not rely on computational hardness assumptions.
        \item Quantum adversaries cannot gain an advantage in breaking the soundness of the sum-check protocol.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Random Oracle Model}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the protocol relies on the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, we model the hash function as a quantum-accessible random oracle.
        \item Recent work shows that under certain conditions, the security proofs can be extended to the quantum random oracle model (QROM) \cite{unruh2015non}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Foldable Codes Security}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The security of the foldable codes depends on their minimum distance and the randomness in their construction.
        \item Quantum adversaries cannot efficiently decode or forge codewords due to the high minimum distance and lack of structure.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Overall Protocol Security}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All components of the protocol have been analyzed for quantum security, and no vulnerabilities have been identified that a quantum adversary could exploit.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, the EndGame protocol maintains its security properties in the presence of quantum adversaries.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Security Analysis of Binary Field Operations}

\begin{theorem}[Security of Binary Field Operations]
\label{thm:binary-field-security}
Assuming that the field size \(2^m\) is sufficiently large (i.e., \(m \geq \lambda\), where \(\lambda\) is the security parameter), the use of \(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}\) in the EndGame protocol does not compromise security.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Field Size}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item By choosing \(m \geq \lambda\), we ensure that the field has at least \(2^\lambda\) elements, providing sufficient security against brute-force attacks.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Collision Resistance}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The probability of random collisions in field elements is negligible (\(2^{-\lambda}\)).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Sum-Check Protocol Over \(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}\)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The soundness of the sum-check protocol depends on the field size.
        \item The error probability is at most \(d / |\mathbb{F}_{2^m}|\), where \(d\) is the degree of the polynomial.
        \item With \(m \geq \lambda\), the error is negligible.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Polynomial Commitments}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The binding property of the commitments relies on the minimum distance of the codes and the field size.
        \item The high minimum distance ensures that any two distinct polynomials correspond to codewords that are sufficiently different.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Resistance to Algebraic Attacks}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Attacks exploiting the structure of \(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}\) (e.g., using linear algebra over finite fields) are infeasible due to the large field size and the randomness in the code construction.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, operations over \(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}\) do not introduce security vulnerabilities, provided that \(m\) is chosen appropriately.
\end{proof}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hash Function Output Size}: Use hash functions with outputs of at least \(2\lambda\) bits to counter quantum attacks.
    \item \textbf{Code Parameters}: Select the code rate \(R\) and minimum distance \(\delta\) to balance efficiency and security, ensuring that \(\delta\) is sufficiently high.
\end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Polynomial Commitment Manipulation}:
    \begin{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}

The EndGame protocol satisfies the desired security properties, including completeness, knowledge soundness, zero-knowledge, and post-quantum security. The integration of the BaseFold commitment scheme and the careful design of recursive composition preserve these properties. Our detailed analysis and proofs demonstrate that the protocol is secure under standard cryptographic assumptions and is robust against a range of attack vectors.


\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have introduced \textbf{EndGame}, a novel recursive zk-STARK protocol that efficiently operates over binary fields $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ by integrating the \textbf{BaseFold} polynomial commitment scheme. Our work addresses the significant challenges associated with recursive STARK constructions over binary fields, particularly concerning efficient polynomial commitments, optimized arithmetization, parallel proof generation, and maintaining security properties such as transparency and post-quantum security.

\subsection{Contributions}

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Field-Agnostic Polynomial Commitments}: We have adapted the BaseFold polynomial commitment scheme to work efficiently over binary fields, utilizing random foldable codes that maintain high minimum distance and support efficient folding operations. This advancement allows for secure and efficient commitments without relying on large field sizes or special field characteristics.

    \item \textbf{Optimized Binary Field Arithmetization}: We developed an optimized Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR) that efficiently handles binary field operations within the STARK framework. By representing field elements as binary polynomials and carefully defining constraints for addition, multiplication, and inversion, we achieve a practical and efficient arithmetization suitable for recursive proofs.

    \item \textbf{Recursive STARK Construction}: We designed a recursive STARK protocol that enables efficient verification of previous proofs within new proofs over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. Our construction ensures that security properties are preserved through recursive composition, and we provided detailed algorithms and proofs to validate correctness and soundness.

    \item \textbf{Parallel Proof Generation and Batch Verification}: To enhance scalability and reduce proving times, we implemented parallel proof generation techniques, including a parallel scan state and batch recursion. These methods leverage modern computational resources to handle large-scale computations and proofs efficiently.

    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Security Analysis}: We provided a rigorous security analysis of the EndGame protocol, demonstrating that it satisfies completeness, knowledge soundness, zero-knowledge, and post-quantum security. Our proofs are grounded in standard cryptographic assumptions and address potential attack vectors, ensuring the robustness of the protocol.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Theoretical Implications}

Our work advances the field of zero-knowledge proofs and recursive STARKs in several ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bridging Efficiency and Practicality}: By addressing the inefficiencies in polynomial commitments over binary fields, we make recursive STARKs over such fields practical for real-world applications.

    \item \textbf{Field-Agnostic Innovations}: Our integration of BaseFold demonstrates that efficient polynomial commitments can be achieved over any finite field, broadening the applicability of STARKs and other cryptographic protocols.

    \item \textbf{Advancing Recursive Proof Systems}: The recursive composition techniques and security preservation methods we developed contribute to the theoretical understanding of recursive proof systems and their capabilities.

    \item \textbf{Post-Quantum Readiness}: Ensuring post-quantum security in our protocol positions EndGame as a future-proof solution in the evolving landscape of cryptographic threats.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Practical Impact}

The practical implications of our work are significant:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Blockchain Scaling}: EndGame enables efficient recursive proof aggregation in blockchain systems without requiring trusted setups, facilitating scalability and enhanced security.

    \item \textbf{Privacy-Preserving Computation}: Our protocol supports efficient verification of computations while maintaining zero-knowledge, making it suitable for applications requiring privacy, such as confidential transactions and secure multi-party computation.

    \item \textbf{Distributed Systems Integrity}: The ability to efficiently verify large-scale computations and proofs enhances the integrity and trustworthiness of distributed systems, including cloud computing and distributed ledger technologies.

    \item \textbf{Quantum-Resistant Protocols}: By incorporating post-quantum security measures, EndGame ensures long-term viability against emerging quantum computing threats.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future Work}

While EndGame represents a significant advancement, there are several avenues for future research and development:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimizing Prover Efficiency}: Further work can be done to reduce the prover's computational overhead, possibly through more advanced arithmetic optimizations or hardware acceleration techniques.

    \item \textbf{Improving Verification Times}: Research into more efficient verification algorithms, perhaps leveraging new mathematical insights or cryptographic primitives, could enhance the protocol's practicality.

    \item \textbf{Extending to Other Fields and Structures}: Investigating the application of our methods to other finite fields or algebraic structures may broaden the scope and applicability of recursive STARKs.

    \item \textbf{Security Enhancements and Analysis}: Continued analysis of the protocol's security in various models, including non-interactive and publicly verifiable settings, can strengthen its robustness.

    \item \textbf{Implementation and Standardization}: Developing optimized implementations, benchmarking in real-world environments, and contributing to standardization efforts will facilitate the adoption of EndGame in practical applications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Closing Remarks}

EndGame marks a substantial step forward in the development of efficient, secure, and practical recursive zk-STARKs over binary fields. By overcoming longstanding challenges and integrating innovative techniques, we provide a protocol that is both theoretically sound and practically viable. We believe that EndGame lays the groundwork for future advancements in zero-knowledge proofs, cryptographic protocols, and secure computation, contributing to the broader goal of building trustworthy and efficient cryptographic systems.
